# Recipe Page

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to build a simple and clean recipe page using only HTML and CSS. This was a great exercise in semantic HTML and responsive layout basics.
